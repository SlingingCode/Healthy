# Healthy
We are a group of colleagues who decided to follow up our results of training and non-training.

## The intention with this repo
To build a simple application for registering and following up the values ​​from our weekly weighing. We are using an advanced person scale showing weight, BMI, fat percentage, muscle percentage and a few other values.

## Contribute
You are welcome to contribute, and if you like, fork it and evolve the code base to something completely different than just a storage for scale data.

## Background
I (Markus) needed to build some small, simple, proof of concept kind of application for learning some interesting techniques.
So 100% of the implementation might not be school-book example level. Some of it might be better though, depending on the book.

## Tech
The following is a list of tech I aim to use in this little application.

### Backend
* .NET Core
* Entity Framework Core
* Web API

### Frontend
* Angular
* ngrx
* Angular Material
* scss

### Environment etc.
* Try out developing .NET on Mac instead of PC
* Visual Studio Code
* Docker
* Auth with JavaScript Web Tokens
* OpenAPI
* GIT + GitHub

## Misc
The TODO file in the root folder is used with an addon for VSCode called *Todo+* (works nice with *Project+* and *Projects+ Todo+*)
If you like to try out *Todo+*, you can find it's website here
